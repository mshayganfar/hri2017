We have conducted a user study to investigate the importance of emotional
awareness and the underlying affect-driven processes during a human-robot
collaboration. The goal of this user study was twofold: (1) Investigating the 
overall functionality of the mechanisms and the underlying algorithms in our
architecture, (2) Evaluating human's willingness and assessment of collaboration
with an emotion-aware and an emotion-ignorant robot. We designed a simple table
top game to simulate the collaborative environment in which a participant and
the robot were ``installing'' a solar panel together. The result of our user
study shows a significant difference between humans' preference of working with
an emotion-aware robot during collaboration.

\section{Introduction}
The idea of robots or other intelligent agents living in a human environment has
been a persistent dream from science fiction books to artificial intelligence
and robotic laboratories. Collaborative robots are expected to become an
integral part of humans' environment to accomplish their industrial and
household tasks. In these environments, humans will be involved in robots'
operations and decision-making processes. The involvement of humans influences
the efficiency of robots' interaction and performance, and makes the robots
sensitive to humans' cognitive abilities and internal states.

We believe that collaborative robots need to take into account humans' internal
states while making decisions during collaboration. Humans express emotions to
reveal their internal states in social contexts including collaboration
\cite{breazeal:sociable-interactive-robots}. Due to the existence of such
expressions robot's emotional-awareness can improve the quality of collaboration
in terms of humans' perception of performance and preferences. Hence,
collaborative robots require to include affect-driven mechanisms in their
decision making processes to be able to interpret and generate appropriate
responses and behaviors. Our aim in this work was to study the importance of
emotional awareness and the underlying affect-driven processes in human-robot
collaboration. We examined how emotional-awareness impacts different aspects of
humans' preferences by comparing the results from our participants collaborating
with an emotion-aware and an emotion-ignorant robot.

This work is implemented as part of a larger effort to assess affect-driven
collaborative robots which are capable of generating and recognizing emotions in
order to be better collaborators. This work is based on the development of
\textit{Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory} which is built on the
foundations of the \textit{SharedPlans} theory of collaboration
\cite{grosz:plans-discourse} and the \textit{cognitive appraisal} theory of
emotions \cite{gratch:domain-independent}.

\section{Related Work}

There are many research areas, including robotics and autonomo-us agents, that
employ the structure and/or functions of emotions in their work with a variety
of motivations behind modeling emotions
\cite{wehrle:motivations-modeling-emotion}. In
\cite{breazeal:sociable-interactive-robots} authros surveyed some of the
principle research in social robotics and its applications in Human-Robot
Interaciton. We can see the application of emotion theories in designing robots
capable of learning from humans \cite{breazeal:expressive-behavior}, robots
capable of expressing emotions \cite{cameron:expression-hri}
\cite{shayganfar:methodology} and social behaviors
\cite{paiva:emotion-modeling}, as well as robots which can convey certain types
of emotion products, e.g., empathy \cite{leite:empathy-hri}. There are also
several works in which researchers have explored the human's affective state as
a mechanism to adapt the robot's behaviors during the interaction
\cite{breazeal:sociable-robot} \cite{liu:affect-robot-behavior}.

\begin{figure*}[tbh]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/framework-croped.pdf}

  [title suppressed for anonymity] theory (arrows indicate primary influences
  between mechanisms and data flow).}}
  \vspace*{-5mm}
  \label{fig:framework}
\end{figure*}

Many of the computational models of emotions and their applications are derived
from appraisal theories of emotion making appraisal as the central process in
their architectures \cite{adam:bdi-emotional-companion}
\cite{marinier:behavior-emotion} \cite{marsella:ema-process-model}
\cite{si:modeling-appraisal-tom-journal}. Appraisal is usually modeled as the
cause of emotion being derived via simple rules on a set of appraisal variables.
In robotics, appraisal theory has been used to establish and maintain a better
interaction between a robot and a human \cite{castro:autonomous-robot-fear}
\cite{kim:model-hri-appraisal} \cite{pontier:women-robot-men}
\cite{vogiatzis:robot-museum}. There are other models of emotions that have been
also used in robotics and human-robot interaction \cite{klug:emotion-based-hri}
\cite{lim:mei-motherese-ei} \cite{zhang:service-robot-dimensional}.

There are also other examples that researchers focus on the applications of
emotions in human-robot collaboration. For instance, in
\cite{guha:emotion-feedback} researchers use robot's emotional expression as a
feedback to the human to improve the quality of collaboraiton. In
\cite{looije:affective-collaboration-safety} authors introduce some theoretical
concepts that affective collaborative robots can enhance joint human-robot
performance by adapting the robot's role and interaction to the human's
affective state. This work does not provide any details of implementation and
how these theoretical concepts can lead to a better human-robot collaboration.
However, little effort has been put on development of functions of emotions and
their applications in decision making and emotional-awareness processes of
collaborative robots.

\section{Implementation}
The implementation of this user-study included two separated parts. The first
part incorporated the [Title Suppressed For Anony-mity] Framework consisting of
all Mental Processes (see left-side of Figure \ref{fig:framework}) briefly
described in Section \ref{sec:theory}. The second part was implemented to
recieve action commands from the framework and forwarding them to the robot to
control joints and actuators (see right-side of Figure \ref{fig:framework}).

\subsection{[Title Suppressed For Anonymity] Framework}
\label{sec:theory}
This framework is built based on [Title Suppressed For Anonym-ity] Theory which
deals with the interpretation and prediction of observable behaviors in a dyadic
collaboration \cite{shayganfar:theory-overview}. The theory focuses on the
processes regulated by emotional states \cite{shayganfar:goal-management}. The
observable behaviors represent the outcome of reactive and deliberative
processes related to the interpretation of the self's relationship to the
environment. [Title Suppressed For Anonymity] Theory aims to explain both rapid
emotional reactions to events as well as slower, more deliberative responses.
The reactive and deliberative processes are triggered by two types of events:
\textit{external} events, such as the other's \textit{utterances} and
\textit{primitive actions}, and \textit{internal} events, comprising changes in
the self's mental states, such as belief formation and emotional changes. The
theory explains how emotions regulate the underlying processes when these events
occur. It also elucidates the role of \textit{motives} as goal-driven
emotion-regulated constructs with which a robot can form new intentions to cope
with events.

The framework includes the mechanisms depicted as mental processes in Figure
\ref{fig:framework} along with the mental states. The mental
states shown in Figure \ref{fig:framework} comprise the knowledge base required
for all the mechanisms in the overall model. These \textit{mental states}
include self's (robot's) beliefs, intentions, motives, goals and emotion
instances as well as the anticipated mental states of the other (human). The
details about all these metal states are beyond the scope of this paper. 

Each mechanism includes one or more processes in our architecture. For instance,
the \textit{Collaboration} mechanism includes processes such as \textit{Focus
Shifting} and \textit{Constraint Management}, while the \textit{Appraisal}
mechanism includes processes to compute the values for individual appraisal
variables \cite{shayganfar:emotional-awareness}
\cite{shayganfar:appraisal-short}. The \textit{Collaboration} mechanism
maintains constraints on actions, including task states and the ordering of
tasks, and provides processes to update and monitor the shared plan. In this
user-study, the \textit{Collaboration} mechanism uses a hierarchy of goals
associated with tasks in a the Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) structure
depicted in Figure \ref{fig:collaboration_structure}. The \textit{Appraisal}
mechanism is responsible for evaluating changes in the self's mental states, the
anticipated mental states of the other, and the state of the collaboration
environment. The \textit{Coping} mechanism provides the self with different
coping strategies associated with changes in the self's mental states with
respect to the state of the collaboration. The \textit{Motivation} mechanism
operates whenever the self a) requires a new motive to overcome an internal
impasse in an ongoing task, or b) wants to provide an external motive to the
other (i.e. human) when the other faces a problem in a task. The \textit{Theory
of Mind} mechanism infers a model of the other's anticipated mental state. The
self progressively updates this model during the collaboration.

  task model.}}
  \vspace*{-5mm}
  \label{fig:collaboration_structure}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Robot Controller}
The robot controller is comprised of two major components: ROS-bridge and joint
controller (see Figure \ref{fig:framework}).
Ros-bridge\footnote{http://wiki.ros.org/rosbridge\_suite} provides an API to ROS
functionality for non-ROS programs which enables us to send action commands from
our framework (implemented in JAVA) to the robot's joint controller. The joint
controller receives action commands and translates them into actual joint and
actuator commands and sends them to the robot.

\section{Experimental Scenario}

Our scenario was based on a table top turn-taking game that we designed to
simulate installing a solar panel. Participants had to collaborate one-on-one
with our robot to complete all the given tasks required to install the solar
panel. All the tasks were simple picking up and placing collaborators' available
pegs on predefined spots on the board (see Figure \ref{fig:game_board}). Each
pick-and-place was associated with the robot's or the participant's task. The
robot and the participants had their own unique primitive tasks that they had to
accomplish in their own turn. The final goal of installing a solar panel
required the robot and the participants to accomplish their own individual
tasks. Failure of any task could create an impasse during the collaboration.

\subsection{The Robot}

We conducted our experiment based on a KUKA Youbot (see Figure
\ref{fig:environment}). The robot was stationary on top of a desk and was able
to pick up and place avaiable pegs corresponding to the robot's task. The robot
was operated based on Robot Operating System (ROS) and was receiving commands
through the ROS-bridge from our [Title Suppressed For Anonymity] framework (see
Figure \ref{fig:framework}).

\subsection{Interaction Paradigms}
\label{sec-interaction-paradigms}
The robot interacted via a) speech, b) the corresponding utterance on the
screen, c) negative, positive and neutral expression of emotion through an
emoticon on the screen. The robot used neutral expression in case of the
emotion-ignorance. The interaction was controlled autonomously by the AMC
framework in case of the emotion-awareness, and Disco in case of the
emotion-ignorance (see Section XYZ). The reasoning about which task should be
done and controlling the robot was entirely autonomous. Only the perception of
the task failure or achievement by the robot or by the participant was done by a
wizard monitoring the collabortion outside of the test area. The interaction was
structured based on the exact same goals in an HTN for both conditions. The
robot was using the same utterances in both conditions. In emotion-aware
condition only if the participant was expressing a negative emotion in case of a
failure the robot was using a different utterance in compare to the
participant's positive or neutral expression of emotion; i.e., the robot's
utterances were identical in emotion-aware and emotion-ignorance cases if in the
latter the participant reported (expressed) a positive or a neutral emotion. At
the beginning of each collaboration the robot asked each participant to achieve
the overall shared goal, i.e., ``installing the solar panel''. Then, before
achieving a new goal, the robot informed the participant about the higher level
nonprimitive goal of which the primitives were going to be achieved. The same
procedure was used by the robot if there was a decision for switching to another
nonprimitive due to the failure of the task achieving the current goal. For
example, \ldots (see Figure \ref{fig:collaboration_structure}). After achieving
a new primitive goal, the robot either informed the human keeping the ground for
the next goal to achieve, or informed and passed the ground to the human to
execute the next task with repoect to the human's goal. In case of the human's
turn, the robot waited for the human to do a task, then the wizard let the robot
know whether the human's goal was achieved or not. Afterwards the robot was
making a decision about which goal to pursue and was informing human
accordingly. The same entire procedure was applied to both conditions.

\begin{figure}[tbh]

  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figure/gameBoard.pdf}
  \caption{The layout of the available spots for the human and the robot to
  place their pegs during the collaboration.}
  \label{fig:game_board}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Environment and Tasks}

The environment was set up in Human-Robot Interaction lab. and included the
robot, the collaboration board on top of a desk, and the participant standing in
front of the robot on the other side of the board (see Figure
\ref{fig:environment}). One of the experimenters monitored the interactions
using a live stream of a camera in a different room. The experimenter provided
only the required perception, i.e., decision on success or failure of the tasks
for the robot, through the entire time of the collaboration (see Section
\ref{sec-interaction-paradigms}).

The tasks were defined based on the HTN structure shown in Figure XYZ and were
executed in a turn-taking fashion by either of the collaborators. For each task
either the robot or the participant was responsible to pick up one of the
corresponding pegs from their own inventory and place it on the right spot which
was colored and tagged same as the associated peg.

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

The non/social functions of emotions impact a collaboration process. Human
collaborators prefer to collaborate with others whose behaviors are influenced
by these functions of emotions depending on the context. We developed seven
hypotheses on positive influence of emotion-awareness and usefulness of emotion
function during collaboration:

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 1.}} Subjects will prefer to collaborate with the
robot which is controlled by Affective Motivational Collaboration framework more
than the robot which is controlled by Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 2.}} Subjects will find a mutual understanding in the
collaboration with the robot which is controlled by the AMC framework more than
the robot controlled by Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 3.}} Subjects will find working with the robot which
is controlled by AMC framework less confusing than the robot controlled by
Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 4.}} Subjects will find the robot which is controlled
by AMC framework understanding their goals more than the robot controlled by
Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 5.}} Subjects will find the robot which is controlled
by AMC framework understanding their feelings more than the robot controlled by
Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 6.}} Subjects will find the robot which is controlled
by AMC framework more helpful in compare to the robot controlled by Disco.

\textit{\textbf{Hypothesis 7.}} Subjects will find the robot which is controlled
by AMC framework more trustworthy than the robot controlled by Disco.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
Participants were first given a brief description of the purpose of the
experiment. After the short introduction, they were asked to review and sign a
consent form. Participants were then provided with a written instruction of
their task and the rules for collaborating with the robot. Then, one of the
experimenters lead them into the experiment room and asked the participants
to asked to answer pre-experiment questionnaires. Afterwards, the experimenter
went through all the important details of the instructions with the participants
standing in front of the collabortion board and the robot. The experimenter
confirmed participants' correct understanding of the tasks and informed them
with type of task failures that might occur during the collaboration.
Participants were told that researchers were developing a collaborative robot
and would like their help in evaluating their design. Participants were provided
with identical instructions and randomly assigned to the conditions in the
experiment. They were told that, after their collaboration with the robot, they
would be asked to answer a questionnaire on their experience. After completing
the first round of collaboration, participants answered a post-experiment
questionnaire that measured their perceptions of the robot, the task, and
the collaboration procedure. After answering the first post-experiment
questionnaire, participants were told that they were going to collaborate with
the robot one more time and the robot might not necessarily have the same
collaborative behavior. After completing the second round of collaboration,
participants were asked to answer the second post-experiment questionnaire which
included the same questions as the first post-experiment questionnaire. After
all, participants were asked to answer an open-ended questionnaire which
measured their perception of difference between two runs, their preference of
collaborative robot between two runs, and thier reasons of preference.

\subsection{Measurements}

In our study two basic conditions of the robot were tested: a) controlling the
robot using Disco, b) controlling the robot using AMC framework. The
collaborative results were measured using objective and subjective measurements.

\textit{\textbf{Objective -- }} We measured participants' recall of the
collaborative behaviors presented by the robot using an open-ended
post-experiment questionnaire. We also specifically asked the participants what
behavior of the robot did they like during their collaboration.

\textit{\textbf{Subjective -- }} We evaluated participants' levels of
satisfaction, trust, confusion, goal achievement, as well as mutual
understanding of goals, mutual understanding of feelings, mutual agreement, and
also participants' beliefs about the efficiency of collaboration and their
feeling of robot's collaborative behaviors. Seven-point Likert scales were used
in all questionnaire items.

\subsection{Participants}
\label{sec:Participants}
A total of 37 participants participated in the experiment in 74 trials.
Participants were recruited from Worcester Polytechnic Institute's students and
staffs as well as other civilians recruited from outside of the campus. The ages
of the participants varied between 19 and 74 with an average of 34.2 years
before our screening of 4 subjects based on our sanity check questions. After
this screening the ages of the participants varied between 19 and 54 with an
average of 30.8 years old. Of all the 33 participants, 21 were female and 12
were male. Each participant participated in 2 trials. In one trial the robot was
controlled using Disco and in the second trial the robot was controlled using
AMC framework. The order of these two trials were randomly assigned to each
participant. In general we used Disco first in 16 experiments, and AMC framework
first in 17 experiments.

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:procedure}, results of the user study were
gathered through a 31-question Likert-scale survey that was given to each participant
after each run with the robot, and through a 5-question open-ended summary
questionnaire at the end of the experiment.
\subsection{Results from the 7-Point Likert Scale Survey}
As mentioned previously, the 7-point Likert scale survey was administered at
the end of the emotion-ignorant run and at the end of the emotion-aware run for
each participant. The 31 questions are generally categorized to evaluate the
humans' perceptions of the following seven categories, with 3-6 questions per
group: (1) the likability of the robot (2) the level of trust the human feels
in the robot (3) the human's perception of the robot's performance (4) the
human's perception of the robot's understanding of human's emotions (5) the
human's perception of the robot's understanding of human and collaboration
goals and objectives (6) the human's feeling about the collaboration and (7)
the human's perception of the human's and robot's mutual satisfaction with each
other as collaborative partners. Of the 31 questions, 2 were chosen from each
group, for a total of 14 questions, for presentation in this paper due to space
constraints; the questions are provided in Figure \ref{fig:14Questions-Table}.
These questions are chosen as representative of the group of questions, and
their results do not necessarily represent the highest levels of statistical
significance.

The results were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test to analyze the
difference of means between the emotion ignorant and the emotion-aware
condition. Refer to Figure \ref{fig:14Questions} for the results. As mentioned
in Section \ref{sec:procedure}, participants were randomly assigned to complete
either the emotion-ignorant or the emotion-aware run first; analysis of the
results revealed no statistically significant difference or discernible pattern
based on which run the participant completed first.

\subsubsection{Likability of the Robot}
\label{sec:Likability}
Questions 1 and 2 addressed the likability of the robot. As shown in Figure
\ref{fig:14Questions}, participants would like to continue working with the emotion-aware
robot significantly more than the emotion-ignorant robot by an average of about 1.5
points; additionally participants felt more close to the emotion-aware robot
than the emotion-ignorant robot by about 2.1 points, on the 7-point scale. This
supports Hypothesis 1, which stated that humans would prefer to work with the
emotion-aware robot over the emotion-ignorant robot.

\subsubsection{Human Trust in the Robot}
\label{sec:Trust}
Questions 3 and 4 were designed to measure the degree of trust that the human
participants felt in the robot. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:14Questions},
participants trusted the emotion-aware robot an average of 1.5 points more than
the emotion-ignorant robot, both in general and in terms of collaboration
performance. In fact, in Question 4, participants rated their trust in the
emotion-aware robot to perform appropriately during collaboration an average of
5.9 on a 7-point Likert scale, where 7.0 would indicate maximum trust; this
indicates that the participants felt that the emotion-aware robot's
collaborative performance was acceptable and reliable. This result supports
Hypothesis 2, that posits that human participants would find the emotion-aware
robot to be more trustworthy than the emotion-ignorant robot.

\subsubsection{Perception of the Robot's Performance} 
\label{sec:Performance}
Question 5 measures the participant's perception of repetitiveness in the robot
during the collaboration. In both conditions, participants rated the robot as
moderately repetitive, with the emotion-ignorant robot's average response being
about 1.1 points higher (Question 5 is reverse-scored) than the emotion-aware.
This result correlates with several of the open-ended responses which described
the emotion-aware robot's behaviors as “cute” and “interesting”, refer to
Section \ref{sec:Open-Ended}. The participants also felt that the emotion-aware
robot's decisions during collaboration improved their own performance, with an
average rating of 5.4, while the emotion-ignorant robot only received an average
rating of 3.3, indicating that participants felt it was not able to interact in
such a way as to increase the human's performance; refer to results from
Question 6. These results support Hypothesis 3, which posited that humans will
perceive the emotion-aware robot as being more capable than the
emotion-ignorant robot.

\subsubsection{Robot's Understanding of Human Emotions} 
\label{sec:Emotions}
For Questions 7 and 8, participants ranked the emotion-aware robot's
understanding of emotions 2.2 and 1.8 points higher, respectively, than the
emotion-ignorant robot's understanding of emotions, supporting Hypothesis 4.
This category showed the highest total difference between the emotion-ignorant
and the emotion-aware robot.

\subsubsection{Robot's Understanding of Human and Collaboration Goals}
\label{sec:Goals}
Question 9 was a measure of whether the human perceived that the robot cared
about the human's goal. On average, participants provided an average rating for
the emotion-aware robot that was 1.5 points higher than that for the
emotion-ignorant robot. Question 10 measured the human perception of the
robot's commitment to the collaboration; for this measure, the average
participant score assigned to the emotion-aware robot was 6.2 points out of a
maximum of 7 points, indicating that the participants felt that the
emotion-aware robot was strongly committed to the collaboration. The
emotion-ignorant robot received an average rating of 4.4 points, indicating
only moderate commitment. These results strongly support Hypothesis 5, which
posits that humans will feel that the emotion-aware robot will better understand
their goals than the emotion-ignorant robot. 

\subsubsection{Human's Feeling about the Collaboration}
\label{sec:Collaboration}
Questions 11 and 12 were designed to gauge how the human participants felt
about the partnership within the collaboration and the outcome of the
collaboration. In the emotion-aware condition, participants scored Questions 11
and 12 as 6.1 and 6.3, respectively, indicating a strong sense of pursuing
mutually agreed-upon goals and very high satisfaction with the overall
collaboration. It is worth noting that the participants scored Question 11 for
the emotion-ignorant case at 5.3 points, leading to a 0.8-point difference
between the two conditions; this is the smallest gap that occurs between the
results for any question, and indicates that the participants felt that the
goals still mutually agreed-upon in the emotion-ignorant case. However, the
general satisfaction with the outcome of the collaboration was significantly
less in the case of the emotion-ignorant robot, at 4.8 points. These results
support Hypothesis 6 that humans will feel greater a greater sense of mutual
collaboration and understanding about the collaboration with the emotion-aware
robot.

\subsubsection{Human Perception of Mutual Satisfaction with Collaborative
Partner}
\label{sec:MutualSatisfaction}
Questions 13 and 14 were designed to measure the human's perception of the
robot's satisfaction with the human, and the human's satisfaction with the
robot, respectively. The participants provided an average response in the
emotion-aware condition of 5.8 and 5.9 to Questions 13 and 14, respectively,
indicating a high level of mutual satisfaction; both answers were about 1.5
lower, on average, in the emotion-ignorant condition. These results indicate a
higher level of satisfaction working with the robot in the emotion-aware
condition, and strongly support Hypothesis 7, which posited that humans will
feel a greater sense of mutual satisfaction with the emotion-aware robot than
the emotion-ignorant robot.

\subsection{Results from the Open-Ended Questionnaire} 
\label{sec:Open-Ended}
As described in Section \ref{sec:procedure}, each participant answered an open-ended
questionnaire at the end of the study. Figure \ref{fig:Open-Ended-Table}
summarizes the questionnaire and which run users preferred for certain
conditions (i.e. emotion-ignorant or emotion-aware). Note that some users either
chose not to state a preference, or provided ambiguous answers regarding which
run they preferred for certain conditions; these results were removed from the analysis.
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Open-Ended-Table}, 100\% of users unambiguously
preferred the run with the emotion-aware robot. In general, this preference
stemmed from a feeling of closeness and partnership, as seen in these responses:
``the robot had emotions and responded to my emotions. Also, what it said about
my failing was cute and aimed to make me feel better.'' Another example is ``I
liked feeling needed and accounted for; I felt closer to the robot.'' Finally,
``I saw the changes in its feeling, which motivated me to care more about my
act...I also liked that he asked me to correct its failure, although it could
ask the supervisor.''  

When asked in which of the two runs the robot exhibited
behavior that could be useful in a more complex task, 93.75\% chose the
emotion-aware robot. In general, respondents thought that the emotion-aware
robot was better at problem solving, more adaptable, and more capable of
handling the social complexities that occur in collaboration, as shown in
responses such as ``The robot explained motives...which is important to keep a
team communicating and on the same pace.'' Also, ``When we failed he initially
switched to a new task and then came back to the originally failed task. It kept
me form getting irritated and negative.'' Finally, ``The more complex, the more
necessary it is to understand how humans think and operate...an empathetic robot
can adapt, encourage and help.'' It is worth noting that one respondent
preferred the emotion-ignorant case, saying ``In a more complex task it might be
better for the robot to take control and simply tell me what to do; trying to be
understanding and collaborative wouldn't be as important as doing the task
correctly.'' 

The only question that did not provide statistically significant support in
favor of the emotion-aware robot related to which case the robot exhibited
behavior that could prevent human error. About 40\% of respondents thought that
the emotion-ignorant robot was more likely to prevent human error; however, all
but one of these cited calling the supervisor as the main methodology of
preventing human error, in spite of the fact that the instructions indicated
that the robot's need to call the supervisor counted against the collaboration.
Of the 60\% who thought that the emotion-aware robot was better at preventing
human error, most cited the robot's ability to console the human as the main
behavior that could prevent human error. Respondents indicated that this enabled
them to move on and feel better about the collaboration, as with this response:
``The robot switched to a different task and we came back to an error later.
This allowed my mind to move away from being frustrated. I was able to complete
a different task which felt like a win - then come back and finish the error.
Making my mind move away from frustration could definitely prevent more errors.''

When asked in which of the runs the robot exhibited behavior that could improve
the efficiency of the collaboration, 83.9\% responded with the emotion-aware
case; of these, the vast majority stated that this was because of the robot's
ability to change the order of tasks in the event of a failure, and to ask the
human for help.

Finally, when asked in which run the most interesting behavior occurred, 82.8\%
chose the emotion-aware condition. Of these respondents, 12 individuals stated
that the robot's attempt to console the human by saying ``it's not your fault'' in
response to the human's negative emotion that occurred as a consequence of the
human's failed task was the most interesting behavior, and a majority mentioned
that it actually made them feel more positive. Six participants referred to the
robot's ability to understand and express emotion. Several participants referred
to the robot's ability to communicate, including the ability to ask questions.
Of those who responded with the emotion-ignorant case, most found the ability to
call the supervisor, and mechanical functions, such as gripping, to be most
interesting.

\subsection{Impact of Demographics} 
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:Participants}, we recorded certain identifying
information from each participant, including age and gender. We also had each
participant complete several personality questionnaires. Although it was not the
primary purpose of the study, we investigated the Likert scale results to
determine if there were any relevant trends based on the demographics and
personalities of the participants. A close study of the results did  not reveal
any identifiable pattern based on gender or personality.
 
Age did reveal an interesting pattern. We divided the participants into two
groups, below 30 years of age and 30 or above. While question-by-question
comparisons revealed only a few statistically significant differences based on
age, a consistent pattern emerged. For each of the fourteen questions presented,
the younger age group reported higher scores for the emotion-aware robot (except
Question 5, which is a reverse-score question). In the emotion-ignorant case,
the younger group still scores the robot higher than the older group for 9
questions; for the other 5 questions, the older group scores the
emotion-ignorant robot higher. In fact, a pattern emerged in which the score
drop between the emotion-aware and the emotion-ignorant case was more for the
younger group than for the older group; only questions 4, 6 and 12 broke this
pattern.

\section{Discussion}
Based on the results, all participants prefer to work with the emotion-aware
robot. Humans find the emotion-aware robot more likable and more trustworthy, as
indicated in the Likert-scale responses and the open-ended questionnaire
responses. Based on the responses, the emotional interaction with the robot can
help create a sense of closeness and enjoyment that makes humans want to
continue working with the robot.

The results also indicate that the emotion aware robot can better maintain a
collaborative relationship. Both Likert-scale responses, see Sections \ref{sec:Goals}
and \ref{sec:MutualSatisfaction} and Open-Ended Questionnaire responses indicate
this. Humans felt a stronger sense of the robot's commitment to the
collaboration, and greater understanding of their goals and emotions from the
robot. Several open-ended responses also indicated that the robot was able to
successfully motivate people and maintain their commitment to the collaboration,
especially when tasks failed. Additionally, as shown in Section \ref{sec:Performance},
humans rated the emotion-aware case much higher than the emotion-ignorant case
when asked which robot's decisions improved their performance, in essence
acknowledging that their collaborator's decisions (i.e. the robot) had a
significant impact on their performance. As some of the open-ended responses
indicated, successfully managing emotions within the collaboration can help keep
the collaboration on track, and prevent distractions due to guilt and other
negative emotions.

Finally, the emotion-aware robot developed a stronger sense of  partnership
through greater communication. The participants felt better understood by the
emotion-aware robot, and felt that the goals were more mutually agreed-upon,
refer to Sections \ref{sec:Collaboration} and \ref{sec:Emotions}, respectively. As
evidenced in the following response, the emotion-aware robot was successfully
able to create a sense of partnership through its more open communication style:
``Communication is very important. In the first run (i.e. emotion-aware) the
robot states what tasks he is working on, it is clear and straight-forward. Also
during the first run the robot cares about the human(me)'s feelings and cheers
me up when I failed at the tasks, I think that could also improve efficiency of
collaboration, because it would be more like a team or partnership.''
